# PANE // LANDING

> **Mixing Style With Focus.**

This is the web portal for **Pane**, the Capacitor-based Android productivity tool. It serves one purpose: to look as sharp as the app itself while delivering the latest APK to users without me having to lift a finger after a release.

It is built with **React**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, and engineered to feel "heavy" and premium.

## 🎨 Design System

The UI is unapologetically bold.

- **Typography:**
  - _Display:_ `Space Grotesk` (For the impact).
  - _Body:_ `DM Sans` (For readability).
  - _Code/Tech:_ `JetBrains Mono` (For the specs).
- **Palette:**
  - `pane-navy` (#003566) - The void.
  - `pane-tangerine` (#F77F00) - The energy.
  - `pane-sun` (#FFD60A) - The accent.
  - `pane-cream` (#FDF0D5) - The paper.
